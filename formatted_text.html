  <title>Doctor Who nonsense</title>

  <p>It hasn't been long but I'm already a fan of Doctor Who. To be honest it's kinda hard to get into at first, but thats where the <strong>10th Doctor</strong> comes in.
  I would definitely start at the 10th Doctor if I ever recommend it to someone else.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>Through out the series there will be many times that the so called <em>Doctor</em> will say many things to the point where it almost a catchphrase.
  Ther are many times that the Doctor has <ins>regenerated</ins> through out the series, even going as far back as the first Doctor in 1963.
  And is probably still on going now to this day.</p>
  
  <hr/>
  <p>As the most famous quote at least the most agreed quote from the Doctor is <blockquote>"[Time] Is More Like a Big Ball of Wibbly-Wobbly, Timey-Wimey Stuff."</blockquote>
  But most of the time the 10th Doctor will usually say another famous quote throughout the series until he is <del>dead</del> regenerated to the next Doctor, which the next famous quote is <q>Allons-y</q>.
  Usually the Doctor get around into his adventures with his <acronym title="Time And Relative Dimensions In Space">TARDIS</acronym> which is possible to go visit in real life as its probably a tourist attractions in london.
  It's possible to go see in London with the following address. Which I would totally go see if it was up to me. But that's a future dream of mine to go see in the UK.
  <address>232 Earls Ct Rd, London SW5 9RD, UK</address>
