	<p>Welcome to my webpage! By the time this is posted, this webpage will still not be done. But I Hope you can enjoy all the nosense that will be typed here. Allyons-y!</p>
	<p>Down below is a list of my favorite of things and probably a small breif explanation of why I like them.</p>
	<p>Which I'll start off the list with my favorite games!.</p>
	
	<h3 id="games">My Favorite Games</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Minecraft</li>
    <li>Bully</li>
	<li>Silent Hill 2</li>
  </ol>
    <p>Starting off the list of my number one game was Minecraft. How I discorvered it is a bit of a blur but I remember someone playing it on youtube when I was younger. And why its my number one game is mostly due to the amount of mod support and the amount of freedom in the game.</p>
	<p>And on my second on my list is Bully. Since I wasn't allowed to play GTA or any other game with that much violince in it. I had to stick with this game instead due to personal reasons. After playing it at a family members house, I fell in love with the story and the characters.</p>
	<p>And the last game on the list of my favorites is Silent Hill 2! This game is one that I found on my own, I believe I found it in my teen years. Since I started to get into alot of horror and Silent Hill 2 was one that was recommended to me on the internet. And I'm so glad I did listen to the internet for once. The story was super interesting and emotional as well as the characters.</p>
	
	<h3 id="movies">My Favortie Movies</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>Spider-Man 2</li>
	  <li>The Iron Giant</li>
	  <li>Patch Adams</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Starting off with the movie list is with Spider-Man 2! This has to be the best Spider-Man movie that there is. Spider-Man 2 does go into Peter wanting to have a normal life but can't as his duty to be Spider-man</p>
	<p>The Iron Giant is a movie that is an underrated gem and should get more love and more attention. While the movie is flawed, the movie has a great message and the animation is great. It makes me wish that we still had good movies likes The Iron Giant.</p>
	<p>And the last movie on my breif list is Patch Adams. I recently watched this moive and it's a very feel good movie, even in under serious situation. As much as the real Patch Adams hated the movie, the movie still has a great message about laughter being a good medicine.</p>
	
	<h3 id="music"> My Favorite Music</h3>
	<dl>
	<dt>Green Day</dt>
	<dd>Do you have the time to listen to me whine, about nothing and everything all at once?</dd>
	<dt>Seether</dt>
	<dd>It seems like every day's the same. And I'm left to discover on my own It seems like everything is grey. And there's no colour to behold</dd>
