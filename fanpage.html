                This is where I'm going to write all about my love for Doctor Who. I'll mostly go over characters that I like or hate and go a review on some of the episodes of the series.
                Not only that, but I will probably also post ranting about the series, even if it doesn't make anysense.

            <br />
            <p>Even though it is not done, I will make updates when I can to the site to make it more cool looking, but for now this is what I have.
                Thank you for visiting the link :D
